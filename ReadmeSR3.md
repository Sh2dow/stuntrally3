## 📄Description

Stunt Rally is a 3D racing game, including Sci-Fi elements and own Track Editor.  
Works on GNU/Linux and Windows.  

For cars the game has a **rally** style of driving and sliding, mostly on gravel and loose surfaces.  
It has possible **stunt** elements (like: jumps, loops, pipes). Roads are made from 3D spline.  
It includes many Sci-Fi vehicles and different planets🌌, even surreal locations.  
All [Tracks](https://cryham.org/stuntrally/tracks/) and [Vehicles](https://cryham.org/stuntrally/vehicles/) can be browsed on website.

SR 3.x continues old [SR](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally) 2.x, now using [Ogre-Next](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-next) 3.0 for rendering and [VDrift](https://github.com/VDrift/vdrift) for simulation.

**Documentation** is [inside docs/](docs/_menu.md) dir and has many pages with more information.

## 📊Features

Stunt Rally 3.3 features 232 tracks in 40 sceneries and 33 vehicles.  
Game modes include:
* ⏱️Single Race (with your Ghost drive, track car guide), Replays,
* 🏆Challenges, Championships, Tutorials, (series of tracks), 💎Collections
* 👥Multiplayer (info [here](docs/multiplayer.md), no official server) and Split Screen, up to 6 players.  

The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.  

**Full features** [list here](docs/Features.md).  
**Changes** and new features in [changelog](docs/Changelog.md).  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀Quick Start

[Hardware requirements](docs/Running.md#hardware-requirements). Needs a medium or high end dedicated GPU.

### 🚗Game

Esc or Tab - shows/hides GUI.

Quick setup help is on the Welcome screen, shown at game start, or by Ctrl-F1.  
- Use Ogre config dialog before start to adjust Screen resolution, etc (start with `cfg` argument will show it).  
  OpenGL 3+ Rendering Subsystem is recommended now,  
  but Vulkan seems better on Windows with integrated GPUs or laptops.
- Open Options to pick graphics preset according to your GPU and *do* restart.  
- Open Options tab Input, to see or reassign keys, or configure a game controller, info [here](docs/Running.md#input).  

Game related Hints are available in menu: How to drive, with few driving lessons.  
Have fun 😀

#### Troubleshooting

If you have problems at start, check page [Running](docs/Running.md).  
All settings and logs are saved to user folder, see [Paths](docs/Paths.md). It is also shown on first Help page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🏗️Track Editor

F1 (or tilde) - shows/hides GUI,  
Tab - switches between Camera and Edit modes.  
Press Ctrl-F1 to read what can be edited and how.  

There is no undo, so use F5 to reload last track state, and F4 to save it often.  
After each save, track can be tested in game.  
If needed do manual backup copies of track folder.

[Tutorial](docs/Editor.md) page has more info and few new videos.

## ⚙️Building

How to compile project from sources:  
- On **Linux** is described in [Building](docs/Building.md) (Debian based). Provided script should do it.  
- On **Windows** in [BuildingVS](docs/BuildingVS.md) (difficult), manually building all dependecies from sources first.
